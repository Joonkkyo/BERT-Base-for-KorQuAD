# Graphcore benchmarks: BERT datasets

This directory contains the information required to create pre-training and training datasets for BERT.

`sample_text.txt` is a simple text file for initial pre-training with a small dataset.

The Wikipedia dataset used for pre-training contains approximately 2.5 billion wordpiece tokens. This is only an approximate size since the Wikipedia dump file is updated all the time.

SQuAD is a large reading comprehension dataset used for training (fine tuning) which contains 100,000+ question-answer pairs on 500+ articles.

**NOTE**: these are large datasets - at least 300GB of disk space will be required and the data should be stored on NVMe SSDs for maximum performance. The examples below use a folder structure that matches the config files. If you use a different folder structure, make sure that it is correctly represented in the config file you use.

## File structure

The following files are found in the `bert_data/` folder:

* `create_pretraining_data.py`: Graphcore version which supports option to move MLM tokens to the front of the sequence.
* `dataset.py`: dataset class
* `pretraining_dataset.py`: dataset class for pretraining task
* `squad_dataset.py`: dataset class for SQuAD fine tuning task
* `squad_utils.py`: utils function for SQuAD
* `sample_text.txt`:  sample text used as minimal example to pre-train BERT
* `wiki_downloader.sh`: downloads latest compressed xml file from wikipedia page
* `wikipedia_preprocessing.py`: outputs txt files that can be used as input for  `create_pretraining_data.py`
* `tokenization.py` Tokenizer file used to create pretraining data

## Pretraining data from `sample_text.txt`

The sample text is in a form that is already suitable to create the pretraining data. Run the script as:

`python3 create_pretraining_data.py --input-file path/to/sample_text.txt --output-file data/sample_text.bin --vocab-file path_to_the_vocab/vocab.txt --sequence-length 128 --mask-tokens 20 --duplication-factor 6`

## Wikipedia pre-training data

All the instructions given below should be executed from the `bert_data/` folder. If necessary move to the  `bert_data/` folder first:

`cd /path-to-graphcore-bert/bert_data `

#### **1)** **Download the latest wikipedia dump**

The `wiki_downloader.sh` script can be used to download the latest wikipedia dump. Wikipedia dumps are licensed under a [CC-BY-SA license 3.0](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/legal.html).

`./wiki_downloader.sh path-to-target-folder-for-wikipedia-download-file`

This will download the latest wikipedia dump and place it into the folder passed as an argument.
It is then extracted into a `wikidump.xml` file that can be found inside the same folder.

#### **2)** **Extract training data from dump**

WikiExtractor, https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor, can then be used to extract training data from the wikipedia dump.
A command line example to perform the extraction is the following:

```shell
python  wikiextractor.py -b 1000M --processes 16 --filter_disambig_pages -o /output/path/ /path/to/the/wikidump.xml
```

Inside the target folder there will be a directory called `AA/` that contains files named `wiki_00`, `wiki_01`...

These files have the following structure:

<doc id = article1>
Title of article 1

Body of article 1

</doc>

<doc id = article2>
Title of article 2

Body of article 2
</doc>

and so on.

If different filtering is required then you can use WikiExtractor with other options.
A comprehensive list of options is shown here: https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor.

**3)** **Preprocess the files**

The files from step 3 require further preprocessing with the `wikipedia_preprocessing.py` script:

`python3 wikipedia_preprocessing.py --input-file /target_folder/AA/ --output-file /preprocessed_target_folder`

where `target_folder/AA` contains the files from step 3 and `preprocessed_target_folder` will contain the new files (wiki_00_cleaned, wiki_01_cleaned, ...). The structure of the text in these files is now the same as the structure of the text in the `sample_text.txt` file.

**4) Tokenise the data**

The data can now be tokenised to create the pre-training dataset for BERT. For this step a vocabulary file is required. A vocabulary can be downloaded from the pre-trained model checkpoints at https://github.com/google-research/bert. We recommend to use the pre-trained BERT-Base Uncased model checkpoints.

The script `create_pretraining_data.py` will accept a glob of input and output files to tokenise. Attempting to process them all at once may result in the process being killed by the OS for consuming too many system resources (e.g. memory). The 'create_pretraining_data.py' will open at most `--max-open-files` at a time.

`python3 create_pretraining_data.py --input-file /preprocessed_target_folder/wiki_**_cleaned --output-file /preprocessed_target_folder/wiki_tokenised --vocab-file path_to_the_vocab/vocab.txt --sequence-length 128 --mask-tokens 20 --duplication-factor 6 --max-open-files=1`

**NOTE:** When using an uncased vocab, use `--do-lower-case`.

**NOTE:** Make sure to use the same values for `mask-tokens` and `duplication-factor` when generating the data and pretraining.

Instead of running the above command line for each input file manually, you can use the script
`tokenise_wikipedia.sh` in the `../scripts` to automate the process for a common configuration.
It will tokenise the data for sequence lengths 128 and 384 with mask tokens 20 and 56, respectively.
It assumes that the `preprocessed_target_folder` is `data/wikipedia/preprocessed/`
and that the Bert-Base, uncased checkpoint has been downloaded from Google and is available at
`data/ckpts/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12`.

The Wikipedia dataset is now ready to be used in the Graphcore BERT model.

**5) Create packed pretraining input data**
Starting from the output of step **2)** we first tokenize the data using `create_pretraining_data.py`:
```
python3 create_pretraining_data.py --input-file=cleaned/part-00* --output-file=binarized_data/part --vocab-file=path_to_the_vocab/vocab.txt --do-lower-case --sequence-length 512 --mask-tokens 76 --duplication-factor 1 --dont-rearrange-mlm-tokens-to-front --max-open-files=10
```

**NOTE:** Packing (next step) will produce a dataset with duplication factor of 1, regardless of the duplication factor of the provided un-packed pretraining dataset. It is therefore recommended to also generate the un-packed pretraining dataset (using `create_pretraining_data.py`) with a duplication factor of 1, as shown above. Any additional duplication will go unused by the packing script but would take significant time to generate through `create_pretraining_data.py`.

**Note:** in order to later be able pack the dataset, the option `--dont-rearrange-mlm-tokens-to-front` must be used. This is the crucial difference with the previous use of `create_pretraining_data.py` in step **3)**

The second step is to pack the sequences: 
```
python3 -m bert_data.pack_pretraining_data --input-glob="binarized_data/part_*" --output-dir="packed_pretraining_data" --max-sequences-per-pack=3 --mlm-tokens=76 --max-sequence-length=512 --unpacked-dataset-duplication-factor=1`
```
**Note:** the `pack_pretraining_data` should be run from the parent folder as a python module with no `.py` extension (see example).

**Note:** the argument '--unpacked-dataset-duplication-factor' should have the same value as the `--duplication-factor` argument passed to `create_pretraining_data.py` in the previous step.

**Note:** The argument `--max-sequences-per-pack` controls the depth of the packing problem. A value of 3 is typically sufficient for high packing efficiency at sequence lengths 128 to 512.

The packed Wikipedia dataset is now ready to be used in the Graphcore BERT model.

## Book-Corpus pre-training data

**1) Homemade BookCorpus**

The Homemade BookCorpus scripts can be downloaded from github and setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/soskek/bookcorpus.git ~/bookcorpus
cd ~/bookcorpus
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**2) URL list and File Download**
The following commands can be used to get the URL list and then download all the files in that list. For more details on these scripts consult the Homemade BookCorpus documentation.
```bash
python3 -u download_list.py > url_list.json
python3 download_files.py --list url_list.json --out files --trash-bad-count
```
On successful completeion you will now have approximately 15K documents in the directory .files/.

**3) Concatenate the files**
Concat all text to one sentence per line format using this script:
```bash
python3 make_sentlines.py files > all.txt
```

**4) Tokenise the data**
As with any other data (e.g. Wikipedia) the final step is to tokenise for both sequence lengths used in training:
```bash
cd path_to_graphcore_examples/applications/popart/bert/bert_data
python3 create_pretraining_data.py --input-file ~/bookcorpus/all.txt --output-file ~/bookcorpus/tokenised_128 --vocab-file path_to_the_vocab/vocab.txt --do-lower-case --sequence-length 128 --mask-tokens 20 --duplication-factor 6
python3 create_pretraining_data.py --input-file ~/bookcorpus/all.txt --output-file ~/bookcorpus/tokenised_384 --vocab-file path_to_the_vocab/vocab.txt --do-lower-case --sequence-length 384 --mask-tokens 60 --duplication-factor 6
```

The files ~/bookcorpus/tokenised_128 and ~/bookcorpus/tokenised_384 can now be used in addition to the Wikipedia data to pre-train the Graphcore BERT model.

## SQuAD training data

**1) Training files**

Google describes how to access SQuAD 1.1 training files in its [BERT GitHub repository](https://github.com/google-research/bert).

This command can be used to download the SQuAD training files:
